# A 2-μJ, 12-class, 91% Accuracy Spiking Neural Network Approach For Radar Gesture Recognition
This repository contains evaluation code for radar gesture recognition with SNNs.

Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02669

## Example code

Please run **SNN_12_class_train.py** or **SNN_5_class_train.py**  for training the convolutional SNN.

Run **SNN_12_class_test.py** or **SNN_5_class_test.py** for a quick test using saved SNN models.
